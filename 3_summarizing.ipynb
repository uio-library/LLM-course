The author argues that law and programming languages share a common focus on using precisely structured linguistic constructions to do things in the world, and that programming-language techniques can be useful in solving legal problems. The article surveys the history of research into programming languages and law, and presents ten promising avenues for future research. These include using programming languages to model legal doctrines, using legal drafting tools to improve legal drafting, using programming languages to design legal systems, and using programming languages to interpret legal texts. The article also discusses the challenges and opportunities of interdisciplinary research between law and computer science.\n",
