# An Introduction to running Large Language Models on Fox

This is an introductory course on running Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
UiO [High-Performance Computer Fox](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/fox/).
LLMs, like ChatGPT, are trained to generate word sequences based on a context, i.e. continue word sequences.
For instance, if we have the start of a sentence "The chicken crossed the road to get", some possible completions are "to the other side" or "food".
To learn more about how LLMs are trained, we recommend the videos
[Intro to Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g) and
[Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) by Andrej Karpathy.

In this course, we use Python programming to run LLMs.
Therefore, the course requires basic programming skills.
If you are unfamiliar with programming, we recommend doing a programming course before this course, for example the Software Carpentry course
[Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/).

This course consists of five chapters.
In [](0_login), we log on to Fox.
You will need a user account at the University of Oslo and a smart phone or other means of using two factor authentication (2FA).

In [](1_installing), we install the software that we will need for this course.

In [](2_chatbot), we learn to load and query basic LLMs.

In [](3_summarizing), we use LLMs for making shorter summaries of documents.

In [](4_RAG), we build an application for doing Retrieval-Augmented Generation based on a set of documents.
